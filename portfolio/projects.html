        I need to put borders and sharpen up the nav bar. Possibly can do it using % on borders, if I do a 1% border on
        each, then I should be able to run the bars at 23%, for 92% width on total bars and 8% for borders. If this
        doesn't work, I should be able to double check for overlap BETWEEN boxes, so that it would be 5% per, then I
        potentially need a workaround, possibly a small box on the left with slightly larger borders.
    </p>
    <p>Also, ask why I get stupid top margins if I don't set padding on EVERYTHING to zero.</p>
